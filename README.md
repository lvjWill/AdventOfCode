# AdventOfCode
2022
Code is seperated by each problem in each day
Some days used objects that I made, if you want to see all the methods in the objects open the folders
I used a Cord class in two different days for different problems, one is for day 14 and is labeled with parenthesis, change the name of the file if you wish to run it
The scanner is either System.in, witch is whatever is put in the input box, or a direct file location, change these with your file location
